This repository is made up of informative notebooks meant to be read in a sequential order. 

- **01_background_and_foundations.ipynb**
    - An introduction to Theano, TensorFlow, and Keras. Instructions are provided on installation of relevant libraries.
- **02_multilayer_perceptrons.ipynb**
    - A simple multilayer neural network is constructed via Keras to solve a binary classification problem. Validation methods and hyperparameter optimziation techniques are explored.
- **03_multiclass_classification.ipynb**
    - A simple neural network is constructed to solve a multiclass classification problem.
